# Vancouver Film Industry Visualizations
When the pandemic hit Vancouver in March 2020, the film industry shut down. As it was reopening in the late summer and early fall, we wanted to see what the job landscape would be like. The resource available to us at the the time was the [production list](https://www.dgc.ca/en/british-columbia/avails-and-production-lists/production-list/) pdf at the director's guild of canada website. This shows details of each production, but doesn't give a strong overall picture. The goal of this project was then to visualize the active dates of the upcoming productions. First the start and end dates of each production in the pdf were extracted using the process described [here](https://github.com/clavell/vancouver_film_industry_visualizations/blob/main/process_description.pdf) with tabula and R. The data was then visualized with tableau using Gantt charts to show individual productions in [this file](https://github.com/clavell/vancouver_film_industry_visualizations/blob/main/Individual%20film%20job%20schedules.twbx) and a running tally of active productions by day in [this file](https://github.com/clavell/vancouver_film_industry_visualizations/blob/main/count%20of%20active%20film%20productions20200906.twbx). This offered film workers the opportunity to see at a quick glance when they should be expecting to be back at work. To view the tableau visualizations [download tableau reader](https://www.tableau.com/products/reader) for free. (or see static screenshots below) <br/><br/>
First, here is the Gantt chart of dates for individual production:

Next here is a visualization of active shoots by date. The labels were not very thoughtfully generated at the time and I don't have access to Tableau to change them now, so to get an idea of what they mean: MOW is an acronym for "Movie of the week", which refers to short shooting non-union shows. "Non-MOW" refers to longer shooting shows that are likely union shows, and "value" is the sum of both MOW and non-MOW shows.
